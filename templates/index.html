    GitHug is a little like <a href="https://www.gittip.com/">GitTip</a>, but without credit cards or money. You get one hug per week to give to any user on
    <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> to show your appreciation. It was inspired by a <a href="https://twitter.com/roguelynn/status/227848062842859520">typo by Lynn Root</a>.

    In total, <strong>{{ total_hugs }}</strong> have been given. On average, each user gave <strong>{{ average_hugs_given }}</strong>
    and received <strong>{{ average_hugs_received }}</strong> hugs. This week, <strong>{{ hugs_this_week }}</strong>
    {% if hugs_this_week == 1 %}
        hug was
    {% else %}
        hugs were
    {% endif %}
    given, that is
    {% if hugs_this_week > hugs_last_week %}
        <strong>{{ hugs_this_week - hugs_last_week }} more</strong> than
    {% elif hugs_this_week == hugs_last_week %}
        <strong>the same as</strong>
    {% else %}
        <strong>{{ hugs_last_week - hugs_this_week }} less</strong> than
    {% endif %}
    last week (<strong>{{ hugs_last_week }}</strong>).
